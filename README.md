# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-II

Set of group and individual works in my course on Algorithms and Data Structures II at the University of Buenos Aires.




### Program
1. Abstract types of data and problems

    1. Abstract data types: Linked list; stack; Queue; Array; Binary tree; Set; Map.

    1. Specification: description of problems using abstract types; modularization.

    1. Recursion: axiomatization of functions through recursion; structural induction.
1. Design, data structures and algorithms

    1. Design: concepts; modules; relationship implemented; representation invariant and abstraction function; commutative diagrams.
    1. Algorithm complexity: Asymptotic analysis of the worst case and average case. Notation O (). Upper and lower dimensions.

    1.  Data Structures: simple representations for sequences, stacks and queues; simple representations for maps / sets: sequences, arrays, pointers, binary trees and binary search trees; more elaborate representations: balanced trees, AVL trees, open hashing, closed hashing, and tries; priority queues: heaps. Search and sort in secondary memory. Other data structures for dictionaries.

    1. Sorting algorithms: Basic methods: insertion, selection. Elaborate methods: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort. Sorting algorithms for particular inputs.
1. Algorithmic Techniques
    1.  Divide & Conquer.
    1.  Generalization of functions.
    1.  Elimination of Recursion: folding / unfolding; parameter immersion.
    1.  Application of algorithms and data structures to other problems.
